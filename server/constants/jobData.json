It's how we approach insurance: Make it clear. Make it simple. Make it affordable. By combining exceptional talent, technology, data, and knowledge, Simply Business is the go-to online insurance brokerage that protects small businesses and the entrepreneurs who work hard to build them.\n\nWe want team members who have the drive to challenge boundaries. If you’re smart and passionate about delivering brilliant customer experiences, we’d love to hear from you.\n\nWe need a Software Engineer to join us in Boston.\n\nThis role will develop customer focused products in a culture which champions Agile, cross functional teams and continuous collaboration.\nKey Responsibilities:\n\n• Being hands-on in developing our products using best practices, appropriate tools and technologies\n• Working with cross functional collaborative teams, helping to clarify requirements at the onset of projects and suggesting different and relevant technical approaches\n• Highlighting areas for continuous improvement and driving their prioritization\n• Being proactive in suggesting new tools, technologies and ways of working\n\nOur Tech Stack:\n\n• Ruby/Ruby on Rails\n• Scala\n• MongoDB\n• Spark\n• Redshift\n• Kafka\n• Puppet\n• AWS\n• Docker\n• HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n• React\n\nA handful of things we believe in:\n\n• Continuous delivery - we currently release software to production around 14 times a day on average\n• Cross functional teams – we believe in collaboration across the whole organization and we see Tech and Business teams as one team working together on projects (in fact, we even have our business product owners writing code).\n• Continuous innovation - we do hackathons as one example to drive experimentation with new technologies and ways of working\n• Never chaining ourselves to a technology - using the “right tool for the job”\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n\n• Strong programming skills in any language. We look for strong Engineers and our philosophy is that a strong Engineer is not defined by the technologies they use; therefore Ruby experience is not essential. You’ll just need to be happy to cross-over to Ruby if you join us – and we will support you with that\n• Strong understanding of Agile\n• Strong desire to work collaboratively with business teams. We do not divide ‘business’ and tech’ teams, we see both as one team as we are all working towards one shared goal\n• Strong interpersonal skills to work well in our very open and friendly environment\n• Pro-active in suggesting new tools, processes and technologies – anything which will help us continually improve!\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nHere are some of the great benefits and perks that come from being a Simply Business employee:\n• A salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy, and the market we’re in from your first day\n• Group plan for medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage\n• Short term disability, long term disability, and life insurance coverage\n• Participation in the Company’s bonus program\n• Participation in 401(k) plan with a 3% employer match\n• Commuter benefits to help cut down on parking and public transit costs\n• 25 days of vacation time plus 10 sick days and 10 company holidays\n• A genuine investment in your learning and development\n• Annual company trip, regular outings, and volunteer opportunities\n• An awesome WeWork office with cold brew coffee and other beverages on tap, local pop-up events, and more\n\nSimply Business is an equal opportunity employer. We're committed to welcoming and helping to grow employees within an inclusive & diverse culture. And that commitment starts with our interview process.\n\nOnce you apply, your info will be reviewed in a committee with employees from different levels, teams, and experiences. We pride ourselves on fostering a sense of community, which is only made stronger by each individual at SB, so you'll have the opportunity to meet a variety of people throughout the process. Get excited!\n\nWant more info on working at Simply Business? Check out our careers page: https://www.simplybusiness.com/careers/\n\nWhat's going on with work from home and return to the office?\n\nMore and more, people are talking about going back to the workplace and the new normal. At Simply Business, we’re thinking of it as a Better Normal. That means offering our SBers more choice and greater flexibility to work in a way that’s best for their particular job, their teams, and their lives.\n\nWe’re shifting to a hybrid working model, so we’ll have employees working virtually and in the office at any given time.\n\nWe’re also aware there are times when working together in person is the best way to get things done. We expect our SBers to connect in their hubs (that’s what we call our offices) most likely once every few weeks. That said, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, so we expect all SBers and their teams will find the operating rhythm that works best for them.\n\nIf you’re wondering what it might be like for you at Simply Business, our Talent Acquisition is happy to answer any questions. In fact for them, it’s perfectly normal.\n\nMost of our interviews will still take place over Zoom (however, depending on the role, there may be the opportunity/expectation to meet members of the team in-person). If it looks like you could be a good fit for the role, we’ll ask you to interview on Zoom – you’ll need WiFi and a laptop, or a 4G-enabled smartphone. If you don’t have access to either of these, or you need support with your application, get in touch with us at uscareers@simplybusiness.com. Similarly, please email us with any questions or if you want to pause your application for a bit – we’ll be happy to keep you updated on future opportunities like the one above.","job_is_remote":false,"job_posted_at_timestamp":1658279826,"job_posted_at_datetime_utc":"2022-07-20T01:17:06.000Z","job_city":"Boston","job_state":"MA","job_country":"US","job_latitude":42.36008,"job_longitude":-71.05888,"job_benefits":["health_insurance","dental_coverage","paid_time_off","retirement_savings"],"job_google_link":"https://www.google.com/search?gl=us&hl=en&rciv=jb&q=software&start=90&ibp=htl;jobs#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=software&htidocid=Sap8TH8nYzYAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D","job_offer_expiration_datetime_utc":null,"job_offer_expiration_timestamp":null,"job_required_experience":{"no_experience_required":true,"required_experience_in_months":null,"experience_mentioned":true,"experience_preferred":false},"job_required_skills":null,"job_required_education":{"postgraduate_degree":false,"professional_certification":false,"high_school":false,"associates_degree":false,"bachelors_degree":false,"degree_mentioned":false,"degree_preferred":false,"professional_certification_mentioned":false},"job_experience_in_place_of_education":false,"job_min_salary":null,"job_max_salary":null,"job_salary_currency":null,"job_salary_period":null,"job_highlights":{"Qualifications":["Strong programming skills in any language","We look for strong Engineers and our philosophy is that a strong Engineer is not defined by the technologies they use; therefore Ruby experience is not essential","Strong understanding of Agile","Strong desire to work collaboratively with business teams","We do not divide ‘business’ and tech’ teams, we see both as one team as we are all working towards one shared goal"],"Responsibilities":["This role will develop customer focused products in a culture which champions Agile, cross functional teams and continuous collaboration","Being hands-on in developing our products using best practices, appropriate tools and technologies","Working with cross functional collaborative teams, helping to clarify requirements at the onset of projects and suggesting different and relevant technical approaches","Highlighting areas for continuous improvement and driving their prioritization","Being proactive in suggesting new tools, technologies and ways of working"],"Benefits":["A salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy, and the market we’re in from your first day","Group plan for medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage","Short term disability, long term disability, and life insurance coverage","Participation in the Company’s bonus program","Participation in 401(k) plan with a 3% employer match","Commuter benefits to help cut down on parking and public transit costs","25 days of vacation time plus 10 sick days and 10 company holidays","A genuine investment in your learning and development","Annual company trip, regular outings, and volunteer opportunities","An awesome WeWork office with cold brew coffee and other beverages on tap, local pop-up events, and more"]}},{"employer_name":"Red Clay Consulting","employer_logo":null,"employer_website":null,"job_publisher":"My ArkLaMiss Jobs","job_id":"8-aIoaZFypoAAAAAAAAAAA==","job_employment_type":"FULLTIME","job_title":"Entry-Level Software Consultant","job_apply_link":"https://jobs.myarklamiss.com/jobs/entry-level-software-consultant-atlanta-georgia/918360036-2/","job_description":"Entry-Level Software Consultants will assist the implementation team in designing, implementing, and testing the necessary configuration changes to a number of packaged products within the Oracle Utilities suite of solutions.\n\nAs a Consultant, a Typical Day Might Include the Following\n• Will work as part of a small to medium sized team throughout the entire software development lifecycle\n• Travel on-site.

science, Carbon3D is commercializing a fundamental advance in the chemistry of 3D printing that enables massive increases in print speed and improved material properties. We believe our technology will enable commercial customers to go beyond basic prototyping to mass production of 3D printed parts.\nTexture mapping is a very important problem for Carbon as we continue to enable customized parts fabricated using 3D printing. With 3D printing, textures can be directly printed onto parts for both aesthetic and functional purposes, such as increasing frictional grip on shoe soles. Texture mapping relies on constructing smooth maps called UV maps between a complex surface and a flat space (called the texture space). UV mapping is hard to do in a fast, robust, and smooth way. This internship is about expanding on approaches Carbon engineers have started with UV mapping, and will involve optimization of geometric parameters to result in smooth deformations of shapes. The intern will be able to participate in a world class engineering and R&D team for computational geometry and design, get experience in product development, and work with Carbon's customers.\n\nIn this internship, you will:\n• Conceive and develop novel, robust, and efficient texturing algorithms for 3D printing applications.\n• Implement proof-of-concept prototypes that redefine the state-of-the-art in the field of computational geometry.\n• Collaborate with a diverse group of team members from prototyping through production to advance the entire project.\n• Contribute research that can be applied to product development for Carbon and industry learning publication.\n\nRequirements:\n• Pursuing a MS/PhD in computer science, machine learning, applied mathematics, or related field.\n• Experience with research publicized in high-impact journals and international conference presentations or publications.\n• Experience working on a team that ships products.\n• Proficiency in C++ and Python.\n• Proficiency in developing and using CAD and geometry packages such as CGAL, Libigl, Blender, Maya, OpenCascade, SolidWorks, etc.\n\nNice to have:\n• Building and shipping significant software components.\n• Enthusiastic about creating geometry tools and using software to create game-changing 3D printed hardware!\n• Experience working with writing CUDA code for GPUs.\n• Experience working with front end development, including TypeScript, React, Three.js, etc.\n\nWe are excited about this internship season! At Carbon, we look at the person holistically and carefully consider a wide range of factors when determining compensation. The pay range for this position is $50.00 - $55.00 per hour.

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee. They help their people change projects all the time: you don't get stuck in one role for years (unless you want to stay in it). And wouldn't it be nice to be somewhere where you don't have to worry about a layoff if a project ends? The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research and other missions. They prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need TS/SCI + FS Poly Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Analytic / Big Data Software Engineers, Full Stack Developers, Cloud Engineers, and Systems Administrators in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage.

Fetch points, perhaps.\n\nSecond, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers. -- Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right?\n\nThat's why we're building the world's rewards platform.

Our patented technology protects at-risk workers from harm using bi-directional panic alarm technology for pinpoint accuracy. We leverage hardware and software to provide hotels and healthcare facilities with the ability to supply staff with wearable panic buttons that summon help with one touch of a button.\n\nOur technology has helped workers with serious injuries, harassment, medical emergencies, de-escalating tense situations, and more. We are a certified B-Corporation, meeting the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.\n\nOur solution has prevented violence for both workers and guests. Examples include:\n• A housekeeper used her ROAR button to get help for a female guest who was being physically beaten by her partner. The manager was able to stop the incident and the abusive husband was reported to the police.\n• A strange man who was not staying in the hotel rode the elevator with a guest who used their key card to gain access to their floor. He hid in a linen closet and attacked one of the female employees when she walked in, beating and choking her. Fortunately, she activated her ROAR button to get hotel security to her exact location. Help arrived quickly, and he was apprehended and turned over to the police. More importantly, she was provided with first aid and has recovered, grateful it was not worse.\n• Nurses and clinicians point to their buttons as a de-escalation tool when a patient is being aggressive or unruly.\n• Nurses have also leveraged the button to get help quickly when a patient falls.\n\nHistory of ROAR\n\nThe company started in 2014 by empowering women with one of the first safety devices built as a fashionable and wearable alternative to existing self-defense tools. In addition, we invested a portion of the proceeds into empathy education to help get to the root of reducing attacks in the first place. ROAR became a market leader in 2017 with sales in over 45 countries and distribution through Amazon, Target, and Urban Outfitters. We received press coverage from Mashable, MTV News, the NY Times, and we won product and technology awards Top 10 Wearable Companies by Entrepreneur Magazine, Technology Startup of the Year, and others.\n\nIn 2018, we parlayed our personal safety experience and technology expertise to focus on workplace safety starting with the hospitality industry. We did so after seeing the staggering number of housekeepers who experience sexual harassment or at more at risk to be injured due to their nature of their work.

We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!\n\nNearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data travelling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and size to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.\n\nWe tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognise our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).\n\nWe know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way.

Since 2018, our business has grown faster than any other provider in the space. We work with some of the largest venture capital firms in the world, building software to automate managing their investments. As we head deeper into 2022, our goal is to forge the future of how this industry operates and our hammer is engineering. We are building a distributed system that needs to be configurable enough for the most complex of customers. Its responsibilities are wide: money movement, an event-based general accounting ledger, calculating profit waterfalls, rule-based engines for reconciliations and allocations, workflow orchestrations, investment performance tracking, integrations from crypto wallets, incorporation tooling… just to name a few.\n\nOur business is set to double this year which is why we need you.\n\nInterested? Keep reading!\n\nDon’t know what any of these things are? Keep reading!\n\nWho we are\n\nWe care deeply about our customers: investors, fund managers, fund administrators, tax/audit professionals, and others. We are relentless in our pursuit to create leverage for them. We do so by deeply understanding the domain and the jobs to be done. We run towards hard and messy problems. We serve the business, first and foremost, and invest in ourselves and each other in service of that effort. We are owners and that is the only title that matters.\n\nWe take our work seriously, but not too seriously. We take equal pride in solving complex business problems like automating allocation calculations, as we do contributing to our Slack emoji portfolio. Stand-ups might include discussions on implementation details for a new Kafka event or our favorite microwavable snacks.\n\nYour Role at Carta\n\nYou will join our R&D team of learners, builders, experts, and leaders in our Investor Services group. Our group is building the next generation of software for the venture capital industry. We build software to help new funds launch, investors to track analytics and performance, for fund accountants operating the books and financial records for investment funds ranging from $100k through billions under management, and more. We work on a mix of greenfield opportunities and work informed by metrics.\n\nAbout You\n\nWhether you are a new college graduate or a Staff Engineer with 10 years of leadership experience, you continuously strive to improve yourself and those around you. Additionally,\n• You have strong technical skills and are an excellent collaborator.\n• You like solving for ambiguity: we’ll look to you for ideas on how to solve problems.\n• You implement systems large or small that are clear, maintainable, and correct.\n• You are excited by opportunities to both break ground on new projects and provide fresh perspective onto past implementations.\n• You want to build and own your work end-to-end.\n• You are eager to move fast, but recognize when to build for the future.\n• You may be passionate about some elements of the Carta tech stack (Python, Django, Javascript, React, Postgres, GRPC, Kafka); such experience is helpful but we do not require it.\n\nWe look for candidates who are interested in, experienced with, or curious about…\n• Accounting or investment management\n• Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology\n• Customer relationship management\n• Document data extraction and digital signatures\n• Tax reporting and financial auditing\n• Banking and money movement\n\nThe Interview Process\n\nCarta follows a standard tech startup interview process, where you will meet with a recruiter and hiring manager first. We’ll then ask you to show off your skills with a real-world take home exercise (we do not do LeetCode-style interviews, no one will quiz you on writing a doubly-linked list) and virtual interviews. During the process, you can ask questions to people across different parts of the Investor Services team to learn what kind of work we do and how it lines up with your interests.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com.

The flagship SPAN Smart Panel is the first true evolution for the traditional home electric panel, harnessing enhanced technology for metering, monitoring, and control. An expanded product suite of intelligent, integrated solutions radically lowers the cost and complexity of energy upgrades–including solar, batteries and EVs–empowering homeowners to be active, resilient and informed players in the energy market.\n\nThe Role\nAs an engineer on the Device Software team, you will define and implement new features directly related to SPAN’s hardware products. Hardware products are central to SPAN’s business and writing firmware for even our smallest microcontrollers means working on something that directly affects the user experience. The team is small and you will own large user-facing features from conception through implementation, working independently to bring them to completion. Our goal is to hire friendly, smart engineers who like to work on in collaborative teams to solve complex problems. Ownership and autonomy are large and you can expect to work directly with the product, software, and hardware teams to ensure the right things get built.\n\nThe Team\nSPAN’s Device Software team is responsible for the software that is physically embodied in our hardware products. Our first product - the SPAN Panel - contains a complex network of microcontrollers and a single board computer that must work together to react quickly to changing conditions with impeccable reliability to perform its job. The Device Software team touches every part of that system from 8-bit microcontrollers through embedded Linux, sometimes extending down to the electrical hardware below and up to the cloud infrastructure our devices speak to.\n\nWe look for friendly, excellent engineers who enjoy working with their peers to solve complex problems. We prioritize autonomy, trusting that the people we hire are capable of great things when supported by a team, and encourage everyone to exercise their agency in pursuing solutions. Engineers work directly with the broader software, product, and hardware teams to ensure the right things get built at the right time.\n\nResponsibilities\nIn this role, you will do a combination of:\n- Working across hardware and software boundaries on complex multiprocessor systems\n- Writing firmware for microcontrollers both on bare metal and for RTOS (FreeRTOS) environments\n- Writing system software on embedded Linux\n- Working with product owners to specify, estimate, break down, and author new features\n- Collaborating with our Electrical Engineers to specify, bring up, and troubleshoot new PCBAs\n\nAs we are a startup, this list is neither exhaustive nor complete. We are excited for people to explore responsibilities outside their areas of expertise if the need or interest arises. We also do not expect every candidate to do all of these things; we each work on the areas of our interest and skill set.\n\nRepresentative Projects\n- Digging into the onboard temperature sensor in a SOC to understand and debug the manufacturer's calibration process\n- Writing service in Rust to communicate with a new home IoT device, then working with the cloud and mobile team to design the homeowner onboarding and commissioning flow for it\n- Designing a security and authentication strategy to allow a homeowner to safely access web resources hosted on their home panel\n- Writing a tool in Python to help the systems team explore the communication protocol of a new solar inverter\n- Exposing time-critical metrics from our hardware to help the business team better understand our customers\n- Designing and building software infrastructure to allow our data scientists to deploy machine learning models to the field, then collect and analyze results\n- Working with the product team during the conception of a new product to define what kind of local communication is possible at the install site\n\nAbout You\nRequired Qualifications\nWe are seeking a Firmware/Embedded Linux engineer with:\n- Experience writing software for a hardware device (in Linux, and/or on a microcontroller, etc)\n- 1+ years of Software Engineering experience\n- A desire to consider how your work fits into the larger puzzle of the SPAN product and business, and a track record of taking ownership of projects and features.\n- Understanding engineering principles and processes to design robust, scalable, and resilient systems\n- Experience with modern software development processes like unit testing, continuous integration, and version control\n\nBonus Qualifications\nWe do not expect any engineer to have all skills, but we do want you to be excited to learn and grow. Every Device Software Engineer is free to roam up and down our device software stack, so any combination of the following skills is welcome but not required.\n- Experience with functional safety and processes/standards like ISO-26262, IEC 61508, and UL1998\n- Exposure to Rust (the programming language)\n- Experience writing C, especially memory management and pointers\n- Exposure to real-time operating systems (especially FreeRTOS) or systems programming in general\n- Familiarity with a higher level language like Python/C++/Java/Rust/etc and Object-Oriented design\n- Wireless technologies like WiFi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee\n- Experience writing or debugging Linux userspace and kernel drivers, especially around network interfaces\n- Experience with electronics lab equipment\n\nLife at SPAN\nSPAN embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills.\n\nHeadquartered in San Francisco’s vibrant SoMa neighborhood, we are an eclectic group of creative thinkers who value open communication, teamwork, and a ‘make it happen’ approach to addressing complex challenges.\n\nOur CEO, Arch Rao⁠—former head of the Tesla Powerwall team⁠—fosters an energetic and collaborative environment, with a strong emphasis on maintaining work-life-balance across the organization.\n\nWe’re hiring talented individuals who are driven by success and are passionate about shaping the future of renewable energy. If that sounds like you, we’d love for you to consider joining the rapidly growing team at SPAN.\n\nThe Perks:\n⚡ Competitive compensation + equity grants at a well-funded, venture-backed company\n⚡ Comprehensive benefits (including medical; dental, vision, life and disability insurance)\n⚡ Comfortable, sunny office space located near BART and Caltrain public transit\n⚡ Strong focus on teambuilding and company culture (events, meet-ups, clubs)\n⚡ Flexible hours and unlimited PTO\n\nOur Mission & Values:\nAt SPAN, we believe that powering your home with clean energy should be a simple and delightful experience that is at its essence human-centered and technology-forward.\n\nOur core values include:\n- Making home energy more accessible, intuitive, and convenient.\n- Enabling homes and vehicles to be powered by the sun.\n- Building resilient homes with reliable power.\n- All-electric everything.\n- A more flexible & distributed grid.\n\nInterested in joining our team?
